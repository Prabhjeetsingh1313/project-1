bike riding project

The presentation focuses on a data wrangling project analyzing bike riding data using Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries. It encompasses three main tasks:

Data Acquisition and Wrangling for Dataset 1 & 2: Employing various techniques such as merging, dropping unnecessary columns, and exploring central tendency statistics to understand rental patterns.

Data Acquisition and Wrangling for Dataset 3: Handling missing values, detecting outliers, and integrating this dataset with the combined data from Datasets 1 and 2.

Data Analysis: Evaluating skewness and correlation within the combined dataset, supported by visual representations using charts/graphs.

The presentation omits explicit titles in favor of a more concise and content-focused structure, covering the technical approach, tasks undertaken, and the learning outcomes attainedâ€”highlighting the importance of data wrangling for effective analysis and the proficiency gained in data manipulation using Python libraries.
